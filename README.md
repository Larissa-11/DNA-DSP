# DNA-DSP: Integrated DNA Data Storage Platform for Primers Design, Codec, Synthesis and Sequencing Simulation and Method Evaluation
The code Implementation of the paper "DNA-DSP: Integrated DNA Data Storage Simulation Platform".

## Implementation
The DNA-DSP Web platform is entirely coded in Python, with data storage and management handled by MySQL. The backend is built on the Django framework, while the frontend is developed using the Vue.js framework combined with the Element Plus UI component library, providing an intuitive and visual interface. By utilizing WebSocket technology, the platform enables real-time information processing, ensuring that users receive the latest results promptly when data is updated, significantly enhancing the interactive experience and operational efficiency. The platform is accessible on popular browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, and is primarily intended for non-commercial research.
